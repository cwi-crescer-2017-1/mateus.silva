<p> <h1> <strong> Atlas Shrugged </strong> </h1> </p>
<p> If  you don't know, the thing to do is <em> not get scared</em>, but to learn.<br>
 People think that a liar gains a victory over his victim. What I’ve learned  is that a <strong>  lie
is an act of  making  that person one’s master, self-abdication</strong>, because one surrenders one’s reality
 to the person to whom   one lies, condemning oneself from then on to faking the  sort of reality that
person’s view <em> requires to be faked… </em>  The man who lies to the world, is the world’s slave from then on…
There are no white lies, there is only the blackest of destruction, and a white lie is the blackest of all. </p>
