<p> <h1> Atlas Shrugged </h1> </p>
<p> <strong> If </strong>  you don't know, the thing to do is <em> not get scared</em>, but to learn.
<br> People think that a liar gains a victory over his victim. What I’ve learned  is that a <strong>  lie <br>
is an act of making that person one’s master, self-abdication </strong>, because one surrenders one’s reality
<br> to the person to whom  one lies,condemning oneself from then on to faking the  sort of reality that
<br>person’s view <em> requires to be faked… </em> The man who lies to the world, is the world’s slave from then on…
<br>There are no white lies, there is only the blackest of destruction, and a white lie is the blackest of all. </p>
